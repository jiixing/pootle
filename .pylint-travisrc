# Travis specific pylint configuration #
# ######################################
#
# For Travis we only care to fail if a test fails, so no fancy reporting
#
# Adding new enabled checks:
# 1. They must pass
# 2. They must pass reliably, no false positives
# 3. Prefer a checker over and individual check
# 4. We don't include anything that the devs can't agree on in terms of linting
